# Wireless-Attack-Lite
Lightweight Version of Wifi-Attack-Autoloader for Outdated Releases of Kali Nethunter (Python 2.7.9)

# Who is this for?
Anyone stuck with a crappy Asus Nexus 7 Tablet (2012), or any other device no longer officially supported by the Kali Nethunter Project

It sure kept my crappy tablet useful!
